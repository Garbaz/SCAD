# SCAD

Random 3D Models made in OpenSCAD. Mostly small and highly specific stuff that probaby is only of use to me.

Any bigger projects, especially ones that others might find useful I have in [separate repositories](https://github.com/Garbaz?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=openscad&sort=stargazers).
